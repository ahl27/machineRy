# MachineRy: Machine Learning Models for R

This is somewhat of a sandbox for me to write machine learning models that will be
incorporated into other packages (e.g., SynExtend).

Current implementations:

- Feed-forward multilayer perceptron: sort of works, pretty buggy
- Random Forest: works for classification, working on adding pruning and some other features
