# MachineRy: Machine Learning Models for R

This is somewhat of a sandbox for me to write machine learning models that will be
incorporated into other packages (e.g., SynExtend). So far, contains an implementation 
for a feedforward multilayer perceptron. This implementation seems to work but is relatively
buggy. Random forests are coming soon.
